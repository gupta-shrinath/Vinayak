# Idea 
* A simple application that can report and monitor disasters.
* The main purpose to create the application was to learn kotlin and various android components.
* The implemented concepts follow best practices with respect to the application context.
* If you have any optimization or best practices or you wanna build something on top of it please feel free to do so.

# Android Concepts 
* Runtime Permissions
* Service
* Broadcast Receiver
* Room Persistent Library
* Location Services and Google Maps

# Additional Info 
* You will have to add MAPS_API_KEY to `local.properties`.You can learn more about it [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start)
* You can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gupta_shrinath) if any query.
